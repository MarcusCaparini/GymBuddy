The prototype has some of the screens built in a rudimentary fashion,
but connections between screens currently do not work. 

There are also some obvious ways to improve this project:
- The navigation bar should use the correct nav objects instead of the 
    method show in the example prototype. 
- The Workout and Exercise objects could be their own type of widget 
    with appropriate properties. 
- variable names, overloading methods, (general low priority errors) 
    could be cleaned up. 
- It might be nice to use the containers such as recycler view to hold
    lists. 


As much as I would love to work on this project more right now, I need
to focus on some other matters this summer.

Hopefully this prototype and the example prototype are sufficient to
for either myself or kaelan to continue from where this dropped off
in the next semester.
