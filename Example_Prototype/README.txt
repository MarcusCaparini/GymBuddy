The purpose of this project is to demonstrate some basic competencies 
in android studio in the simplest manner possible. It's probably pretty
poor code. 

The first screen demonstrates how to create new activities, as well as 
take input and output from a textbox. 

The second screen demonstrates the use of simple fragments. 
- the first button will always give you default screen one. 
- the second button will demonstrate using an action in a fragment
    to change the fragment you're looking at. 
- the third screen shows a fragment nested within a fragment, and the 
    ability to change it's display.


Note that this is meant to be extremely barebones to demonstrate how
each of these things work. Code that would be helpful in a larger project
but does not change operation of the above features has been removed.
